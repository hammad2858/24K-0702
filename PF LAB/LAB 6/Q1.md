**Which loop system would be better for user input. Justify your answer by creating a program
that takes a value and adds it to a variable and prints it repeatedly until the user enters a zero
value** 

**ANS :  While loop   as soon zero is entered the loop ends and outputs the final sum while before entering zero the program was adding the numbers.** 
**CODE**
int main() {
    int sum = 0, num;

    do {
        printf("Enter a number : ");
        scanf("%d", &num);
        sum += input;
        printf("Current sum: %d\n", sum);
    } while (num != 0);

    printf("Final sum: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
